# Global Nest Tracker

This plugin is intended to make it easier for players to work out what items have been tried on the nest in Aldarin. The sidebar contains all tradable items, and marks them as untested, and whether or not you get a different item back from them.

Data is sent to a database for storage, and is queried by your client to find out what everyone's done.
